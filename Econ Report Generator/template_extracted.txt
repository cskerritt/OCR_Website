ECONOMIC LOSS APPRAISAL REPORT  
Introduction 
 
This Economic Loss Appraisal Report has been prepared by [Expert Name], a forensic economist, 
in the matter of [Case Name], to evaluate the economic losses resulting from [Plaintiff’s] injuries (or 
wrongful death). The purpose of this report is to quantify various categories of economic damages in 
a manner that is clear, comprehensive, and compliant with the Daubert standard for expert 
testimony. The key components of loss addressed include: 
• 
Lost Wages/Earnings Capacity – the value of past and future income (and benefits) lost 
due to the incident. 
• 
Future Medical and Healthcare Costs – the present value of reasonable future medical 
expenses related to the injury. 
• 
Loss of Household Services – the economic value of household tasks and services 
[Plaintiff] can no longer perform. 
 
All findings are presented in plain language with technical details explained for a general audience. 
Specialized terms are defined throughout the report and in a glossary. The methodologies used are 
grounded in well-established economic principles and reliable methods that have been published in 
peer-reviewed literature and are generally accepted in the field. This report adheres to Daubert 
criteria by using reliable principles and methods, referencing peer-reviewed sources, discussing 
potential error rates or uncertainties, and applying the methods to the facts of this case. All 
assumptions, data sources, and calculations are documented in the sections below, and all opinions 
are stated to a reasonable degree of economic certainty. 
 
Report Structure: After summarizing the data and assumptions considered, the report details each 
category of loss in turn (Lost Wages, Future Medical Costs, Household Services), followed by a 
summary of total losses. Each section outlines the methodology and reasoning, ensuring 
transparency and layperson accessibility. A final section provides requisite expert disclosures, 
including qualifications, materials reviewed, assumptions, exhibits, and a signature attestation. 
 
Materials Considered 
 
In preparing this analysis, I have reviewed and relied upon the following materials and data (among 
others): 
• 
Case Documents: [List key documents: e.g. Complaint, deposition of [Plaintiff], accident 
reports]. 
• 
Medical Records & Life Care Plan: [e.g. Medical reports from Dr. A; Life Care Plan by 
[Name] dated ___ outlining future care needs]. 
• 
Employment & Earnings Records: [e.g. pay stubs, W-2 forms, tax returns, employment file 
from [Plaintiff’s] employer]. 
• 
Economic & Statistical Data: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (wage data, Consumer Price 
Index), published worklife expectancy tables, life expectancy tables (e.g. U.S. CDC Life 
Tables), and relevant economic research literature. 
• 
Other: [Any other data: e.g. vocational expert report, family testimony on household 
services, etc.]. 
 
(Modify the above list as needed for the specific case, ensuring all materials considered are listed.) 
 
Key Assumptions 
The following assumptions underlie the calculations in this report (to be adjusted per case specifics): 
• 
Employment but for Incident: It is assumed that absent the incident, [Plaintiff] would have 
continued working in their usual capacity up to a normal retirement age of [X] years (or for

[Y] additional years of worklife). This worklife expectancy is based on statistical averages 
adjusted for [Plaintiff’s] age, gender, and work historyresearchgate.net. 
• 
Post-Incident Work Capacity: [Plaintiff] is now unable to work (or can only work in a 
limited capacity earning $___ per year), per medical/vocational evidence, resulting in a loss 
of earning capacity as detailed below. 
• 
Fringe Benefits: Employer-provided benefits (health insurance, retirement contributions, 
etc.) comprised approximately [Z]% of wages and are included as part of the lost 
compensationphysicianlcp.com. 
• 
Income Taxes: Calculations of lost earnings are presented on an [after-tax basis] (if 
applicable under jurisdiction) so that the award reflects net take-home pay loss. A combined 
federal/state tax rate of ___% is assumed for this purpose. 
• 
Life Expectancy: [Plaintiff] has a remaining life expectancy of ___ years, based on 
[source, e.g. U.S. Life Tables], which is used to project future losses through the year 
____. If the injury is expected to impact longevity, medical expert input is used to adjust this 
expectation. 
• 
Discount Rate: A discount rate of ___% is used to convert future dollars to present value. 
This rate is chosen to reflect a risk-free rate of return (e.g. based on U.S. Treasury or tax-
free municipal bond yields) appropriate for a lump-sum awardweaver.com. 
• 
Inflation Rates: Future wage growth and medical cost inflation are assumed at ___% 
annually (based on historical data and current economic forecasts for wages and healthcare 
costs, respectivelyweaver.com). These inflation assumptions are paired with the discount 
rate to ensure consistency (e.g. real vs. nominal projections). 
• 
Household Services: It is assumed that [Plaintiff] performed approximately ___ hours per 
week of household and family services pre-incident (based on time-use data or family 
testimony), and that due to the injury [he/she] can no longer perform [all or a specific 
portion] of these tasks. The types of services affected include [list: e.g. cleaning, cooking, 
childcare, yard work]. 
• 
Mitigation: Any mitigation or offset (such as actual earnings post-incident, or replacement 
services provided by others) has been considered and will be noted in the calculations. It is 
assumed that [Plaintiff] has made reasonable efforts to mitigate losses where possible. 
 
(Each assumption should be reviewed and modified to fit the facts of the case. Additional 
assumptions can be added as needed.) 
 
Methodology and Daubert Reliability 
 
Present Value Concept: All future economic losses in this report are converted to present value, 
which is the amount of money that, if received today and invested, would exactly cover the future 
losses as they come duephysicianlcp.com. Present value calculations account for two key factors: 
(1) expected inflation (the rising cost of wages or medical services over time), and (2) the time 
value of money (the interest or return that can be earned by investing the award)physicianlcp.com. 
By adjusting for these factors, the goal is to ensure the plaintiff is fully compensated without over- or 
under-paying for future needs. In practical terms, this means future dollar amounts are discounted 
back to today’s dollars using an appropriate discount rate, after first incorporating any expected 
growth or inflation in those costs. For example, if a medical expense is expected to cost significantly 
more in 10 years due to medical inflation, we first project that future cost, then discount it to what 
would be needed today to fund that expense. 
 
Reliable Principles & Methods: The methods used in this analysis are standard in the field of 
forensic economics and based on well-established financial principles. These methods have been 
published in economic literature and subjected to peer reviewcfes.com. For instance, the approach 
to valuing lost earnings and benefits draws on published models (such as Dr. Frank Tinari’s 
algebraic method for lost earningsresearchgate.net, discussed below), and the valuation of

household services often uses data from authoritative sources like the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics and the American Time Use Surveytheknowlesgroup.org. Each component of loss is 
calculated using generally accepted techniques in the economics professioncfes.com, and the 
calculations can be tested or replicated by another expert given the same data. Key publications and 
sources supporting these methods are cited throughout this report. 
 
Known Error Rates & Uncertainty: Economic damage assessment is based on forecasts and 
statistical averages; as such, it is not amenable to a precise “error rate” in the same sense as a 
laboratory experimentcfes.com. However, to address uncertainty, conservative assumptions have 
been used and sensitivity analyses can be performed if needed (for example, evaluating how results 
change with a higher or lower discount rate). The data inputs (e.g. wage rates, growth rates) are 
derived from large samples or reliable studies, reducing the likelihood of significant error. The 
methodologies themselves (present value calculations, life expectancy tables, etc.) are transparent 
and have been tested over time in the literature and in courtroom application. In short, while future 
economic projections involve some uncertainty, the approach adheres to “reasonable degree of 
economic certainty” standards. Any potential variability is acknowledged, and the chosen 
assumptions err on the side of reasonable, fact-based estimates rather than speculation. 
Application to Case Facts: Importantly, the principles and models have been applied specifically to 
the facts of [Plaintiff’s] situation. All calculations use case-specific data (such as [Plaintiff’s] actual 
earnings, medical needs, etc.), and the assumptions (worklife expectancy, life expectancy, etc.) are 
tailored to [Plaintiff] (taking into account age, health status, occupation, etc.). By combining 
established methods with case-specific facts, the analysis remains both relevant and reliable, 
satisfying the Daubert requirement that the expert’s methods are reliably applied to the facts at 
hand. 
 
(The above methodology section can be adjusted or expanded as needed. It establishes that the 
expert’s approach is scientifically/technically grounded and Daubert-compliant.) 
 
Lost Wages and Earnings Capacity 
 
This section addresses the lost wages (past and future earning capacity) attributable to the incident. 
“Lost earnings” represent the income [Plaintiff] would have likely earned from employment but for 
the injury (or death), including salary, wages, and fringe benefits such as health insurance and 
retirement contributionsphysicianlcp.com. Both past losses (from the date of incident to the present) 
and future losses (from now through the end of the expected working life) are calculated. The 
analysis employs Frank Tinari’s algebraic methodology for demonstrating lost earnings, which 
condenses the calculations into a clear formula formatresearchgate.net. This algebraic approach has 
the advantage of presenting the loss computation in a straightforward way that is easier for 
laypersons (e.g. jurors) to understand, compared to exhaustive year-by-year 
spreadsheetsresearchgate.net. All calculations, however, can be cross-verified by traditional 
spreadsheet methods, ensuring accuracy and consistency. 
 
Past Lost Earnings (to Date) 
 
[Plaintiff] was injured on [Date of Incident], and as a result has experienced wage loss from that 
date through [present/trial date]. Past lost earnings are computed by comparing [Plaintiff’s] actual 
earnings after the injury to what [Plaintiff] would have earned had the injury not occurred, over the 
same time period. In this case: 
• 
Pre-Incident Earnings Rate: [Plaintiff] was earning $___ per year (or $___ per hour for a 
__-hour workweek) prior to the injury. This is derived from [Plaintiff’s] wage records (e.g. 
pay stubs/tax returns) for the period immediately before the incident.

• 
Post-Incident Earnings: After the incident, [Plaintiff] has earned $___ (if any) through 
alternate work or disability benefits. (If Plaintiff has not been able to work at all post-incident, 
then post-incident earnings are $0.) 
• 
Lost Wages to Date: The difference between expected earnings and actual earnings from 
[Date] to [Date] is $______, which represents wages not earned due to the incident. This is 
calculated year-by-year for each calendar year or partial year. For example, in [Year 1], 
[Plaintiff] lost approximately $___ in wages (expected $___ minus actual $___). Summing 
across all periods yields the total past wage loss. 
• 
Lost Fringe Benefits: In addition to wages, the value of lost employer-paid benefits has 
been included. Using a fringe benefit rate of [Z%], the wage losses were grossed-up to 
account for benefits like health insurance, retirement contributions, etc., that [Plaintiff] would 
have received. This adds approximately $___ to the past losses. 
• 
Adjustments: Past losses are calculated in nominal dollars of each year and, if appropriate, 
brought to current dollars. Some jurisdictions allow adding pre-judgment interest to 
compensate for the lost use of money; if applicable, interest at __% per annum has been 
applied to past losses from the time of loss to present, totaling $___. (Alternatively, if not 
applying interest, note that past losses are already expressed in today’s dollars or as of trial 
date.) 
 
Past lost earnings are essentially a reimbursement for paychecks that [Plaintiff] could not collect 
due to the injury. We look at what [he/she] likely would have made in that time versus what [he/she] 
actually made (if anything), and the shortfall is the economic loss. These figures are based on actual 
documented earnings and thus relatively straightforward. 
 
Future Lost Earning Capacity (Post-Trial) 
 
Future lost earnings represent the present value of the income [Plaintiff] is expected to lose from 
now through the end of [his/her] expected career. This takes into account raises, the likelihood of 
continued employment, taxes, and other factors. Rather than list dozens of years of projections in a 
complex spreadsheet, we employ an algebraic model to encapsulate the key factors influencing 
future earnings lossresearchgate.net. According to the methodology described by Tinari (2016), 
many of the adjustments can be combined into a single formula for clarityresearchgate.net. An 
example of such an algebraic expression is: 
∗∗AIF∗∗={[(GE×WLE)×(1−UF)]×(1−TL)}×(1−PC),**AIF** = \{ [ (GE \times WLE) \times (1 - UF) ] 
\times (1 - TL) \} \times (1 - PC),∗∗AIF∗∗={[(GE×WLE)×(1−UF)]×(1−TL)}×(1−PC), 
 
where AIF is the Adjusted Income Factor (a percentage of gross earnings effectively lost), GE is 
annual Gross Earnings, WLE is the Worklife Expectancy (in years, adjusted for labor force 
participation), UF is the unemployment factor (probability of unemployment in a given year), TL is 
the tax liability rate (to get after-tax income), and PC is the personal consumption rate (the portion of 
income the individual would have spent on themselves)researchgate.netresearchgate.net. This 
formula essentially applies, in sequence, the reductions to gross potential earnings for the probability 
of not working each year (unemployment), for taxes, and (in wrongful death cases) for the 
decedent’s own consumption, yielding the portion of earnings truly “lost” to the 
familyresearchgate.net. The algebraic steps replace what would otherwise be many columns in a 
year-by-year spreadsheet, making the calculation more transparentresearchgate.net. 
Application to [Plaintiff]: Using the above approach (appropriately tailored to this case), [Plaintiff’s] 
future lost earning capacity is calculated as follows: 
• 
Base Annual Earnings (GE): We start with [Plaintiff]’s expected annual income as of the 
valuation date (trial). This is $___, based on current or most recent pay rate (or the average 
of past earnings, adjusted for expected raises). This figure may also consider career 
progression or promotions [Plaintiff] likely would have achieved.

• 
Worklife Expectancy (WLE): Based on [Plaintiff]’s age (__) and other demographic factors, 
the statistical worklife remaining is __ years. This was determined from standard worklife 
tables (which account for labor force participation rates and probability of retirement or death 
before retirement). For example, a __-year-old [male/female] with [Plaintiff]’s education 
typically would be expected to work until around age __, yielding about __ more years of 
work, on average. 
• 
Unemployment Adjustment (UF): To reflect real-world contingencies (illness, job changes, 
layoffs), an unemployment risk factor of __% per year is incorporatedresearchgate.net. This 
means we assume that in any given year, there is a small chance [Plaintiff] might not be 
employed (even without the injury), thereby slightly reducing the total earnings expectancy. 
(For instance, a 3% annual unemployment probability over a career effectively reduces total 
expected earnings by a similar proportion in present value terms.) 
• 
Fringe Benefits (FB): If not already accounted for in GE. We adjust the gross earnings 
upward by [Z]% to include fringe benefits. That is, total compensation = $___ (wages) + 
[Z]% in benefits. This ensures lost health insurance, retirement contributions, etc., are 
included in the loss estimatephysicianlcp.com. (If GE was defined as salary only, we apply 
the (1 + FB) factor in the formula analogous to Tinari’s extended formularesearchgate.net.) 
• 
Taxes (TL): A combined effective tax rate of __% is applied to gross earnings (including 
fringes) to determine after-tax take-home payresearchgate.net. Damage awards for lost 
earnings are typically based on after-tax income (depending on jurisdiction) since the 
objective is to compensate the actual loss to the household. After this adjustment, we have 
[Plaintiff]’s after-tax, after-contingency earnings. 
• 
Personal Consumption (PC): (This factor applies primarily in wrongful death cases.) In a 
wrongful death context, one must deduct the portion of the decedent’s income that would 
have been spent on themselves (personal consumption), because only the income that 
would have been used to support others is considered an economic loss to survivors. Based 
on family size and spending studies, a personal consumption rate of __% is used (e.g., the 
decedent might have used 25% of after-tax income for personal needs, leaving 75% for 
family support). We apply (1 - PC) = __% to the after-tax income to get the portion lost to the 
survivorsresearchgate.net. (In a personal injury case where the plaintiff is alive and is the 
beneficiary of their own earnings, no personal consumption deduction is taken – the full after-
tax income is a loss to them.) 
• 
Resulting Adjusted Income Factor: Combining the above factors yields an Adjusted 
Income Factor (AIF) of approximately __%. For example, if we start with $100 of gross 
earnings, after adjusting for worklife (say 95% remaining on average), unemployment (e.g. 
97%), taxes (say 75% net), and personal consumption (if applicable, say 75% for 
dependents), the result might be around 55% of gross. In fact, Tinari’s example found an AIF 
of about 58.5% in one scenarioresearchgate.net. In our case, the calculated AIF is __%, 
meaning that effectively [only __ cents of each $1 of potential gross earnings is realized 
as an economic loss] after all adjustments. This factor is applied to [Plaintiff]’s projected 
gross earnings stream. 
• 
Projected Earnings and Growth: We project [Plaintiff]’s earnings over the remaining 
worklife, considering raises or productivity growth. An annual wage growth rate of __% is 
assumed. (This may be based on historical average wage inflation or specific industry 
expectations. If using a net discount rate approach, wage growth may be offset against the 
discount rate, see below.) 
• 
Discounting to Present Value: Each future year’s lost earnings (after adjustments above) 
are present-valued to today using the chosen __% discount rate. The present value formula 
essentially divides future amounts by factors of (1 + discount rate)^t for each year t 
aheadphysicianlcp.com. In practice, after applying the AIF to the total projected gross 
earnings, the resulting future loss stream is discounted using standard present value tables 
or formulas. Because our AIF already incorporates many factors annually, what remains is 
primarily to apply the discount factor for the time value of money.

The total present value of future lost earnings is calculated to be $________. This represents the 
lump sum amount that, if invested today at a safe rate, would replace the income [Plaintiff] is 
expected to lose in the future. The calculation can be provided in detail: for example, “After 
adjustments, [Plaintiff]’s annual after-tax lost earnings start at $___ in the first year and would have 
grown to $___ by the final year of work; discounting each year’s loss back to present at % and 
summing yields $_.” To ensure transparency, a simplified table of future losses is attached as 
Exhibit [A], showing a sample of year-by-year lost earnings and present value factors. 
 
Lay Explanation: In simpler terms, for future losses we figured out how much of [Plaintiff]’s expected 
paycheck would truly count as a loss (after considering realities like taxes and the chance of 
unemployment). Then we calculated how much money, if given now, would equal all those lost 
paychecks over the years to come. This involves shrinking future dollars to today’s dollars (since a 
dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today). The end result is a single amount today that 
would replace [Plaintiff]’s lost earning power over time. We rely on established economic formulas to 
do this, which have been demonstrated in economics journals to improve clarityresearchgate.net. 
Notably, Dr. Frank Tinari’s research shows that summarizing the loss calculation algebraically in this 
way can make it more understandable without losing accuracyresearchgate.net. The method used 
here is consistent with that guidance and has been cross-checked for accuracy. 
 
Note: If [Plaintiff] is expected to have any residual earning capacity (for example, can work part-time 
or in a lesser role despite the injury), that post-injury earning capability is taken into account as 
mitigation, reducing the future loss. In this analysis, we have [deducted $___ per year that [Plaintiff] 
can still earn/ factored in that [Plaintiff] will likely secure a job paying $___ starting in 2 years, etc.]. 
The figures above reflect net loss after such mitigation. 
 
Future Medical Care Costs 
This section estimates the future healthcare and life-care expenses that [Plaintiff] will incur as a 
result of the injuries, and calculates the present value needed to fund those expenses. Future 
medical costs often constitute a significant economic loss in personal injury cases, and must be 
evaluated with careful attention to medical necessity, cost inflation, and life expectancy. 
 
Basis of Estimation: Typically, a Life Care Plan prepared by a medical or rehabilitation expert 
serves as the foundation for projecting future medical needs. In this case, we have [relied on the 
life care plan by [Name], or compiled a list of future medical needs from medical expert 
opinions]. The plan outlines various categories of future care, such as surgeries, therapies, 
medications, medical equipment, home health aide services, and other necessities, along with their 
current costs and recommended frequency/duration. These current costs provide a starting point (in 
today’s dollars). However, it’s important to adjust these costs for the future because a life care plan 
itself “doesn’t account for changes in prices over time”weaver.com. Medical costs historically 
tend to rise faster than general inflation, so simply summing up today’s costs over future years would 
underestimate the true needweaver.com. Therefore, we project future cost growth (inflation) and 
then discount those future costs to present value. 
 
Cost Data Sources: We use reliable sources for cost data to ensure the prices are customary and 
reasonable. For instance, life care planners and economists often utilize Medicare rates, private 
insurance data, and local healthcare provider costs as benchmarksfulginiti-law.com. In this 
analysis, the unit costs for medical services and items (e.g. hourly therapy rates, cost of a 
wheelchair, etc.) are drawn from sources such as current Medicare fee schedules, the U.S. Bureau 
of Labor Statistics Medical Price Index, and vendor quotes for medical equipment. All sources 
and pricing are documented for transparencyfulginiti-law.com. Using these data, each element of the 
life care plan is assigned a base cost.

Inflation and Growth Assumptions: Future medical and caregiving costs are expected to increase 
over time due to medical inflation. We have assumed a medical cost inflation rate of __% per year 
for healthcare services, which is based on historical averages of the Medical Care component of the 
Consumer Price Index and other healthcare inflation studiesweaver.com. Notably, medical inflation 
has often outpaced general inflation, though it has shown a moderating trend in recent 
decadesweaver.com. Because different categories of care can have different inflation dynamics (for 
example, prescription drug costs vs. general medical services), category-specific growth rates may 
be applied where appropriate. In absence of specific forecasts (as no official long-term medical CPI 
forecast is universally acceptedweaver.com), our chosen rate reflects a conservative blend of past 
trends and current economic conditions. We will periodically note if certain items have unique 
inflation (for example, home health aide wages might be tied to wage inflation which could differ from 
medical equipment cost inflation). 
 
Life Expectancy and Duration of Care: [Plaintiff]’s future medical needs are projected over __ 
years, consistent with [his/her] life expectancy (or the plan’s stated duration if shorter). If the life care 
plan or medical experts anticipate a reduced life expectancy due to the injury, the projections are 
accordingly limited to that timeframe. Otherwise, we use the standard life expectancy (e.g. to age 
__) as the horizon for ongoing care. Some life care items might be needed only for a finite period – 
for example, [therapy] for 2 more years, or [certain medication] until a condition stabilizes – and 
those are accounted for only in those years. Other items (like attendant care or medical supplies) 
may be needed for life. By summing the needs each year through the end of the planning horizon, 
we capture the full stream of future costs. 
 
Method of Calculation: The future medical costs are calculated in several steps: 
1. Current Annual Cost: Determine the current annual cost of each element in the care plan. 
For example, if [Plaintiff] needs weekly physical therapy sessions at $100 each, that’s $5,200 
per year currently. If home nursing care is needed 8 hours a day at $20/hour, that’s $58,400 
per year currently, and so on for each item. 
2. Inflation to Future Years: Project these costs forward year by year using the medical 
inflation rate. For instance, the $5,200/year therapy cost would be assumed to grow by ~% 
each year (so next year $5,200×1. = $____, etc.). This yields a schedule of future nominal 
costs for each year for each category of expense. 
3. Apply Life Expectancy/Duration: Stop the projection in the year [Plaintiff] is expected to no 
longer need or no longer be alive to require the service. In this case, projections run through 
the year ____ based on life expectancy of __ more years. 
4. Discount to Present Value: Each future year’s cost is discounted back to present value 
using the selected discount rate (here, % as noted earlier). The present value factor for 
year t (for example, 10 years out) is 1/(1+0.)^t. This accounts for the time value of money – 
a cost 10 years from now is divided by approximately (1+0.__)^10 to translate it into today’s 
dollarsphysicianlcp.com. 
5. Summation: Sum all the discounted values for all future years and all categories. This sum 
is the total present value of future medical costs. 
 
Because this process can be voluminous with many items, economists often summarize by finding 
an equivalent single growth rate and single discount rate for the entire plan or by grouping items. 
In our case, a detailed year-by-year model has been constructed (see Exhibit [B] for a simplified 
excerpt), and the aggregate result is reported. 
 
Result – Present Value of Future Medical Costs: Based on the above, the total present value of 
[Plaintiff]’s future medical and life care expenses is $________. This means that an upfront fund of 
that amount, if invested at __% and used to pay for medical needs as they arise (with costs growing 
at the assumed inflation rate), should be sufficient to cover all the future medical needs outlined for

For illustration, some major components are: 
• 
Surgeries: [If any, e.g. one-time future surgery at age __ costs $___ then, PV = $___]. 
• 
Therapies: [e.g. Physical therapy for 5 years, growing from $X to $Y per year, total PV = 
$___]. 
• 
Medications: [e.g. lifelong medication costing $/year now, PV = $]. 
• 
Home Care: [e.g. attendant care $/year for __ years, PV = $]. 
• 
Equipment: [e.g. wheelchair replacements every 5 years at $___ each, PV = $___]. 
(These figures are summed into the total above.) 
 
Essentially, we asked: “How much money is needed today to pay for all of [Plaintiff]’s future medical 
bills, as those bills come due?” To answer that, we first figured out what those future bills are likely to 
be – considering that prices for medical care rise over time – and then we calculated how big of a 
bank account is required now so that, with interest earnings, it can pay all those bills. This ensures 
[Plaintiff] can afford the care [he/she] needs each year in the future. Economists do this by 
combining the life care planner’s roadmap of care with financial math: we inflate costs to future 
years and then discount them back to present. It’s a balancing act – inflation pushes future costs 
higher, discounting pulls them back lower – to find the exact right amount today. The involvement of 
an economist is important because, while doctors identify what care is needed, they don’t usually 
calculate how costs change over decadesweaver.com. Our approach, which is commonly used by 
forensic economists, ensures the plaintiff will be “made whole” for medical expenses – no more and 
no lessweaver.com. 
 
Loss of Household Services 
 
Beyond wages, an injury or death often impairs the ability of an individual to contribute to household 
and family upkeep. Loss of household services refers to the economic value of the domestic 
chores, childcare, and other household tasks that [Plaintiff] can no longer perform (or performs at a 
reduced level) due to the injury. In a wrongful death case, it represents the services the decedent 
would have provided to their family. These services have real economic value because the family 
must either hire someone to perform them or forego them. Examples include cleaning, cooking, 
laundry, home maintenance, yard work, grocery shopping, driving children or elderly family 
members, and even less tangible contributions like guidance or companionship. 
 
Valuation Methodology: The most widely accepted approach to valuing lost household services is 
the replacement cost methodtheknowlesgroup.org. This method asks: What would it cost to hire 
someone to perform the services that are now lost? The steps involved are: 
• 
Identify Services and Time: Determine which household tasks [Plaintiff] was responsible 
for (pre-injury) and how much time [he/she] spent on each. This can be obtained through 
interviews, depositions, or time-use surveys. In our analysis, [Plaintiff] (and/or family 
members) indicated that before the incident [he/she] spent approximately __ hours per week 
on tasks such as [list tasks]. To corroborate and avoid reliance solely on memory, we 
reference data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which provides average time 
people spend on various household activities by age, gender, and family 
situationtheknowlesgroup.org. For instance, according to national data, an average [person 
of Plaintiff’s demographics] might spend about __ hours/week on housework, __ on 
cooking, __ on childcare, etc. These figures are in line with the estimates given for [Plaintiff]’s 
contributions. 
• 
Pre- vs Post-Incident Comparison: Establish how [Plaintiff]’s ability to perform these 
services changed due to the injury. In a personal injury scenario, [Plaintiff] may still do some 
tasks but less efficiently or not at all. For example, [Plaintiff] can no longer do heavy cleaning 
or yardwork and does minimal cooking, resulting in a reduction of __ hours/week of services. 
In a death case, 100% of decedent’s services are lost to the family. The lost services are

essentially the difference: hours of services [Plaintiff] would have provided minus hours 
[he/she] can still provide nowtheknowlesgroup.org. In our case, that lost amount is __ hours 
per week (or __ hours per year). 
• 
Assign Replacement Wage Rates: For each category of service, assign a market hourly 
rate that one would have to pay to replace that service. Sources for these rates include the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics (for roles like 
housecleaner, cook, childcare worker, home maintenance labor, etc.)theknowlesgroup.org, 
or specialized surveys. For simplicity, sometimes an average housekeeping rate is used for 
general housework, and specific rates for specialized tasks (e.g., the rate for a gardener for 
yardwork, a tutor for helping children with homework, etc., if those services were significant). 
In this analysis, we used rates of approximately $__ per hour for general household chores 
(based on local domestic worker wages) and $__ per hour for childcare (based on childcare 
worker wages in our region), etc. Many economists rely on compilations like the Dollar Value 
of a Day reporttheknowlesgroup.org, which utilizes time-use data and wage rates to value 
daily household production. Indeed, the Dollar Value of a Day (2020) study indicates, for 
example, that a [35-44]-year-old female spends about 22.6 hours/week on household 
production valued at about $16/hour on averagetheknowlesgroup.org. These benchmarks 
support our chosen figures. 
• 
Calculate Annual Value: Multiply the lost hours for each task by the corresponding 
replacement wage rate to get an annual dollar value of lost services. For example, if 
[Plaintiff] can no longer do 10 hours/week of housecleaning and the market rate is $15/hour, 
that’s 520 hours/year * $15 = $7,800 per year for cleaning services. Summing across all 
categories (cleaning, cooking, errands, yardwork, childcare, etc.) yields [Plaintiff]’s total 
annual lost household services at current rates. Suppose this comes to $___ per year in 
2025 dollars. 
• 
Projection and Present Value: Just like with other future losses, we consider how long 
these services would have been provided and adjust for inflation/discount. Typically, one 
would project the annual value of services over [Plaintiff]’s remaining life expectancy (or a 
relevant period such as until children reach adulthood for childcare tasks, etc.). Some 
services might decrease in later years (e.g., an elderly person might naturally slow down on 
heavy chores). In our assessment, we assume [Plaintiff] would have continued providing 
substantial household services at the current level for at least __ years, gradually tapering by 
about __% in advanced age. We apply an inflation rate (perhaps general inflation of ~2-3% 
for service wages) to future service values, and then discount back to present value at the 
same __% rate used elsewhere. The methodology parallels the wage loss calculation – 
essentially treating lost household services like a stream of “lost income” to the household. 
 
Alternatively, an even simpler approach (for transparency to a jury) is to take the annual loss value 
and multiply by a life expectancy factor, then discount. For example, if the annual loss is $10,000 
and life expectancy is 30 years, one might compute a present value factor (say about 20.0 at a 3% 
net discount) and arrive at ~$200,000. Our more granular calculation yields a present value of lost 
household services of $________. 
 
This means the family has lost services equivalent to having to spend that lump sum to replace what 
[Plaintiff] would have done at home over the yearstheknowlesgroup.org. 
 
In plain terms, we looked at what [Plaintiff] did around the home – cooking, cleaning, etc. – and 
asked, “If someone had to be hired to do all that, what would it cost?” That cost is a real economic 
loss. We found that before the injury, [Plaintiff] contributed a lot of valuable work at home (worth 
about $___ per year). Now, due to the injury, those contributions are reduced (or gone entirely). The 
family might have to pay for services like housekeeping, lawn care, childcare, or just suffer the loss 
of those services. We calculated the dollar value of that gap. For example, if [Plaintiff] used to do 15 
hours of housework and childcare a week, and now can do none, that’s 15 hours × a market wage

(say $15/hour) = $225 per week, or about $11,700 per year of lost services. We did this for each 
category of task. Then we considered how many years this loss will continue. Using life expectancy 
(or the number of years until [Plaintiff] might otherwise have been unable to do these things due to 
age), we projected the total loss. Finally, we converted those future lost services into a present dollar 
figure, just like we did for lost wages and medical costs, to ensure the value is equivalent in today’s 
terms. 
 
We also acknowledge there are different ways to value household services. Some economists 
consider the opportunity cost method (valuing the time at the person’s own potential wage) or the 
“housekeeper replacement” method (which might use a single domestic worker wage for 
everything)theknowlesgroup.org. However, the specialist replacement cost approach we used 
(valuing each service at its market rate) is generally regarded as the most accurate and courtroom-
tested method. It’s rooted in actual economic behavior – what families actually pay if they outsource 
taskstheknowlesgroup.org. Furthermore, our valuation is comprehensive: it includes not just 
traditional chores but also acknowledges that [Plaintiff] provided intangible but real services like 
parenting and guidance. In fact, literature in forensic economics suggests that companionship and 
guidance services provided within a household can and should be valued by comparing them to 
equivalent services (like a companion or counselor) on the marketresearchgate.net. These are often 
overlooked, but their exclusion could undervalue the loss significantlyresearchgate.net. In this case, 
if relevant (e.g., [Plaintiff] can no longer provide companionship to a disabled spouse or mentorship 
to a child), we have included a reasonable valuation for those aspects as well, using proxy costs (for 
example, the cost of a companion care service, or tutoring/mentoring rates) as appropriate. 
 
Summary of Household Services Loss: [Plaintiff]’s lost household services are estimated at 
$________ in present value. This reflects an annual loss of roughly $___ per year over __ years, 
discounted to today. Details by category (annual value lost): Cooking $; Cleaning $; Laundry $; 
Home maintenance $; Driving/Errands $; Childcare $; Other $___ (totals $___/year). (See Exhibit 
[C] for the breakdown and present value calculation.) This loss is an economic damage just like lost 
wages – it represents either extra expenses the family must bear to replace [Plaintiff]’s contributions, 
or a diminution in their standard of living if those services go undone. 
 
Total Economic Loss Summary 
Combining the categories detailed above, the total economic damages sustained by [Plaintiff] (or 
[Plaintiff’s] family in case of death) are summarized as follows: 
• 
Past Lost Earnings: $________ (from [Date] to [Date], including wages and benefits, plus 
any applicable interest). 
• 
Future Lost Earning Capacity: $________ (present value of [__] years of lost earnings and 
benefits, post-tax, through end of worklife). 
• 
Future Medical Care Costs: $________ (present value of lifetime medical and care 
expenses related to the injury). 
• 
Loss of Household Services: $________ (present value of lost household contributions 
over life expectancy). 
• 
Other Losses: $________ ([Include any other quantified economic losses, e.g., lost 
pension, lost business income, if applicable]). 
Total Economic Loss: $____________ (present value as of [Date]). 
 
(The above figures are illustrative placeholders. In an actual report, they would reflect the computed 
values from each section. A table or summary exhibit often accompanies this to show the 
components clearly.) 
 
These figures represent the economic damages only. They do not include non-economic damages 
like pain and suffering or loss of consortium, which are typically determined by the trier of fact and

not calculated by an economist. The totals provided are the amounts that would compensate for the 
financial losses incurred, assuming the assumptions and projections hold true. 
It’s important to note that each component has been calculated with care to avoid overlap or double-
counting. For example, if home nursing care was accounted for in the life care plan, we do not 
separately count it under household services. Likewise, if [Plaintiff]’s future earnings loss assumes 
retirement at 67, we did not assume any household services beyond that age beyond normal life 
expectancy of providing such services (although retirees do still provide household services, but 
earnings loss ended at retirement, which is separate). All such considerations have been 
consistently applied. 
 
A reasonable degree of economic certainty underlies these calculations. While actual future 
events may differ from projections (longevity, inflation, etc.), the methodology applied is standard 
and produces a best estimate grounded in data. If new information becomes available (for instance, 
an updated medical prognosis or revised life care plan), the figures may be revisited. However, 
based on currently available information, the totals above are our best assessment of the economic 
losses in this case. 
 
Conclusion 
 
In conclusion, [Plaintiff] has suffered substantial economic losses as a direct result of [the incident]. 
Using reliable economic methods and data, we have quantified the losses in earnings, medical 
expenses, and household services, in present value terms. This report provides a comprehensive 
and Daubert-compliant analysis, with each assumption and step grounded in published economic 
principles and tailored to [Plaintiff]’s situation. 
 
It is my professional opinion, based on a reasonable degree of economic certainty, that the totals 
summarized above fairly and accurately represent the economic damages in this matter. The 
methodologies used are consistent with those employed by forensic economists nationwide and 
have been tested for reasonableness and accuracy. All calculations can be found in the attached 
exhibits, and all sources and references used are documented 
hereinresearchgate.netresearchgate.nettheknowlesgroup.org, ensuring transparency. 
 
I certify that I have applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of this case, and I have 
not omitted any material information that would alter the conclusions. I will be prepared to testify to 
these findings at trial and explain the basis for each component of the loss.

damage assessment. [He/She] holds a [Ph.D./M.A.] in Economics from [University] and is a 
[position, e.g. Professor Emeritus of Economics at … / partner at … Economic Consulting]. 
[Expert Name] has provided expert economic testimony in approximately [Y] cases over the past [Z] 
years, in both state and federal courts, and has authored peer-reviewed research in areas of 
economic loss analysis. A full Curriculum Vitae is attached in Appendix A, detailing [his/her] 
qualifications, publications, and prior case experience. Highlights include: 
• 
Specialized expertise in personal injury and wrongful death damages, having completed 
hundreds of economic loss appraisals. 
• 
Membership in professional organizations such as the National Association of Forensic 
Economics. 
• 
Publications, such as “[Title of relevant publication]”, in journals like the Journal of 
Forensic Economics, demonstrating the methods used in this report have been subject to 
academic scrutiny (e.g., Frank Tinari’s methodology referenced in this report is published in 
such literatureresearchgate.net). 
• 
A history of courtroom testimony that meets Daubert standards; no instance of [Expert 
Name]’s testimony has been excluded on Daubert grounds. 
 
Materials Considered: A comprehensive list of all documents and data [Expert Name] relied upon 
is provided at the beginning of this report and can be cross-referenced in Appendix B. This includes 
legal pleadings, medical records, employment records, life care plans, depositions (especially of 
[Plaintiff] and family members regarding household contributions), government data sources, and 
published economic studies (some of which are cited throughout this report). [Expert Name] has also 
considered any reports by other experts in this case (e.g., vocational rehabilitation reports, medical 
expert opinions) to ensure the economic analysis is consistent with those foundations. 
 
Assumptions: Key assumptions made in the analysis are explicitly listed in the “Key Assumptions” 
section of this report. These assumptions were necessary to project future losses (e.g., inflation

They are clearly identified so that if any assumption is later deemed inaccurate, the calculations can 
be adjusted accordingly. None of the assumptions were chosen arbitrarily; each is supported by data 
or literature (for example, inflation and discount rates align with historical 
trendsweaver.comweaver.com, worklife expectancy is drawn from statistical tables, etc.). The effect 
of assumptions has been discussed (see “Known Error Rates & Uncertainty” in methodology), 
demonstrating how variation in assumptions might impact the results.

Glossary of Terms  
• 
Present Value (PV): The amount of money needed today to equal a future stream of 
payments, considering interest and inflationphysicianlcp.com. (E.g., if you need $1,000 in 
five years and you can earn interest at 3%, the present value is about $863 today, because 
$863 growing at 3% for five years becomes ~$1,000.) 
• 
Discount Rate: The interest rate used to convert future values into present value. It reflects 
the rate of return on safe investments (often based on government bonds for damage 
calculationsweaver.com). A higher discount rate means a lower present value for future 
amounts. 
• 
Inflation Rate: The rate at which prices increase over time. Medical inflation refers to the 
rate of increase in healthcare costs, which historically has been higher than general 
inflationweaver.com. We use inflation rates to project how wages or medical costs will grow 
in the future. 
• 
Worklife Expectancy: The expected number of years a person will be active in the labor 
force, given their age, gender, and other factors. It accounts for probabilities of employment, 
unemployment, retirement, and mortality. It’s not just a fixed age of retirement, but a 
statistical average of years remaining in work. 
• 
Life Expectancy: The average number of additional years a person is expected to live, 
based on mortality tables (e.g., a 50-year-old might have a life expectancy of ~30 more 
years). It provides the time frame for projecting future losses like medical costs or household 
services. 
• 
Fringe Benefits: Non-wage compensation from employment, such as employer-paid health 
insurance, retirement contributions, bonuses, and other benefits. These are added to salary 
to reflect total compensation lostphysicianlcp.com. 
• 
Personal Consumption: In wrongful death economics, the portion of the decedent’s income 
they would have spent on themselves. This is deducted because that portion is not a loss to 
surviving dependents (who only lose the portion that would have been used for their 
benefit)researchgate.net. 
• 
Life Care Plan: A document usually prepared by a medical or rehabilitation expert outlining 
an injured person’s future medical and supportive care needs, along with the frequency and 
cost of each item or service, typically for their lifetime. Economists use this as a basis to 
calculate future medical costsweaver.com. 
• 
Replacement Cost Method: A way to value lost services by determining how much it would 
cost to replace those services in the markettheknowlesgroup.org. For household services, it 
uses market wage rates for domestic tasks. 
• 
Opportunity Cost Method: An alternative valuation of lost services or time, based on the 
idea of valuing someone’s lost time at what they could have earned (their wage rate). This 
method is less commonly used in court for household services, as it can overestimate value 
for someone who wasn’t going to be working during that time.

• 
Daubert Standard: The legal standard from Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals (1993) 
used to evaluate whether an expert’s testimony is admissible, focusing on the reliability and

Reasonable Degree of Economic Certainty: A phrase indicating that the expert’s opinions 
are given with a high level of confidence, based on known data and sound methodology. It 
doesn’t mean absolute certainty, but that the conclusions are well-founded and more likely 
than not to be accurate.
