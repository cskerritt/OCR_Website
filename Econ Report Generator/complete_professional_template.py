    intro_text = f"""This Economic Loss Appraisal Report has been prepared by [Expert Name], a forensic economist, in the matter of [Case Name], to evaluate the economic losses resulting from {data.client_name}'s injuries. The purpose of this report is to quantify various categories of economic damages in a manner that is clear, comprehensive, and compliant with the Daubert standard for expert testimony. The key components of loss addressed include:

• Lost Wages/Earnings Capacity – the value of past and future income (and benefits) lost due to the incident.
• Future Medical and Healthcare Costs – the present value of reasonable future medical expenses related to the injury.  
• Loss of Household Services – the economic value of household tasks and services {data.client_name} can no longer perform.

All findings are presented in plain language with technical details explained for a general audience. Specialized terms are defined throughout the report and in a glossary. The methodologies used are grounded in well-established economic principles and reliable methods that have been published in peer-reviewed literature and are generally accepted in the field. This report adheres to Daubert criteria by using reliable principles and methods, referencing peer-reviewed sources, discussing potential error rates or uncertainties, and applying the methods to the facts of this case. All assumptions, data sources, and calculations are documented in the sections below, and all opinions are stated to a reasonable degree of economic certainty.

Report Structure: After summarizing the data and assumptions considered, the report details each category of loss in turn (Lost Wages, Future Medical Costs, Household Services), followed by a summary of total losses. Each section outlines the methodology and reasoning, ensuring transparency and layperson accessibility. A final section provides requisite expert disclosures, including qualifications, materials reviewed, assumptions, exhibits, and a signature attestation."""

    # Key Assumptions with dynamic data
    doc.add_heading('Key Assumptions', level=2)
    assumptions_text = f"""The following assumptions underlie the calculations in this report:

• Employment but for Incident: It is assumed that absent the incident, {data.client_name} would have continued working in their usual capacity up to a normal retirement age. This worklife expectancy is based on statistical averages adjusted for {data.client_name}'s age, gender, and work history.

• Post-Incident Work Capacity: {data.client_name} is now able to work in a limited capacity earning ${data.post_injury_annual_income:,.2f} per year, per medical/vocational evidence, resulting in a loss of earning capacity as detailed below.

• Fringe Benefits: Employer-provided benefits (health insurance, retirement contributions, etc.) comprised approximately {data.fringe_benefits_rate*100:.1f}% of wages and are included as part of the lost compensation.

• Income Taxes: Calculations of lost earnings are presented on an after-tax basis so that the award reflects net take-home pay loss. A combined federal/state tax rate of {data.tax_rate*100:.1f}% is assumed for this purpose.

• Life Expectancy: {data.client_name} has a remaining life expectancy of {data.life_expectancy:.1f} years, based on U.S. Life Tables, which is used to project future losses through the year {death_date.year}.

• Discount Rate: A discount rate of {data.discount_rate*100:.1f}% is used to convert future dollars to present value. This rate is chosen to reflect a risk-free rate of return appropriate for a lump-sum award.

• Inflation Rates: Future wage growth and medical cost inflation are assumed at {data.wage_growth_rate*100:.1f}% annually based on historical data and current economic forecasts. These inflation assumptions are paired with the discount rate to ensure consistency.

• Household Services: It is assumed that {data.client_name} performed household and family services pre-incident, and that due to the injury can no longer perform all of these tasks. The types of services affected include cleaning, cooking, maintenance, and other domestic activities.

• Mitigation: Any mitigation or offset (such as actual earnings post-incident, or replacement services provided by others) has been considered and noted in the calculations. It is assumed that {data.client_name} has made reasonable efforts to mitigate losses where possible."""

    doc.add_heading('Methodology and Daubert Reliability', level=2)
    
    methodology_text = f"""Present Value Concept: All future economic losses in this report are converted to present value, which is the amount of money that, if received today and invested, would exactly cover the future losses as they come due. Present value calculations account for two key factors: (1) expected inflation (the rising cost of wages or medical services over time), and (2) the time value of money (the interest or return that can be earned by investing the award). By adjusting for these factors, the goal is to ensure the plaintiff is fully compensated without over- or under-paying for future needs. In practical terms, this means future dollar amounts are discounted back to today's dollars using an appropriate discount rate, after first incorporating any expected growth or inflation in those costs.

Reliable Principles & Methods: The methods used in this analysis are standard in the field of forensic economics and based on well-established financial principles. These methods have been published in economic literature and subjected to peer review. For instance, the approach to valuing lost earnings and benefits draws on published models (such as Dr. Frank Tinari's algebraic method for lost earnings), and the valuation of household services often uses data from authoritative sources like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the American Time Use Survey. Each component of loss is calculated using generally accepted techniques in the economics profession, and the calculations can be tested or replicated by another expert given the same data.

Known Error Rates & Uncertainty: Economic damage assessment is based on forecasts and statistical averages; as such, it is not amenable to a precise "error rate" in the same sense as a laboratory experiment. However, to address uncertainty, conservative assumptions have been used and sensitivity analyses can be performed if needed. The data inputs (e.g. wage rates, growth rates) are derived from large samples or reliable studies, reducing the likelihood of significant error. The methodologies themselves (present value calculations, life expectancy tables, etc.) are transparent and have been tested over time in the literature and in courtroom application.

Application to Case Facts: Importantly, the principles and models have been applied specifically to the facts of {data.client_name}'s situation. All calculations use case-specific data (such as {data.client_name}'s actual earnings, medical needs, etc.), and the assumptions (worklife expectancy, life expectancy, etc.) are tailored to {data.client_name} (taking into account age, health status, occupation, etc.). By combining established methods with case-specific facts, the analysis remains both relevant and reliable, satisfying the Daubert requirement that the expert's methods are reliably applied to the facts at hand."""

    lost_wages_text = f"""This section addresses the lost wages (past and future earning capacity) attributable to the incident. "Lost earnings" represent the income {data.client_name} would have likely earned from employment but for the injury, including salary, wages, and fringe benefits such as health insurance and retirement contributions. Both past losses (from the date of incident to the present) and future losses (from now through the end of the expected working life) are calculated.

The analysis employs Frank Tinari's algebraic methodology for demonstrating lost earnings, which condenses the calculations into a clear formula format. This algebraic approach has the advantage of presenting the loss computation in a straightforward way that is easier for laypersons (e.g. jurors) to understand, compared to exhaustive year-by-year spreadsheets. All calculations, however, can be cross-verified by traditional spreadsheet methods, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

Past Lost Earnings (to Date)

{data.client_name} was injured on {data.date_of_injury.strftime('%B %d, %Y')}, and as a result has experienced wage loss from that date through {data.date_of_report.strftime('%B %d, %Y')}. Past lost earnings are computed by comparing {data.client_name}'s actual earnings after the injury to what {data.client_name} would have earned had the injury not occurred, over the same time period. In this case:

• Pre-Incident Earnings Rate: {data.client_name} was earning ${data.pre_injury_annual_income:,.2f} per year prior to the injury. This is derived from {data.client_name}'s wage records for the period immediately before the incident.

• Post-Incident Earnings: After the incident, {data.client_name} has earned ${data.post_injury_annual_income:,.2f} annually through alternate work.

• Lost Wages to Date: The difference between expected earnings and actual earnings from {data.date_of_injury.strftime('%B %Y')} to {data.date_of_report.strftime('%B %Y')} is ${past_total:,.2f}, which represents wages not earned due to the incident.

• Lost Fringe Benefits: In addition to wages, the value of lost employer-paid benefits has been included. Using a fringe benefit rate of {data.fringe_benefits_rate*100:.1f}%, the wage losses were grossed-up to account for benefits like health insurance, retirement contributions, etc., that {data.client_name} would have received.

Past lost earnings are essentially a reimbursement for paychecks that {data.client_name} could not collect due to the injury. We look at what they likely would have made in that time versus what they actually made, and the shortfall is the economic loss."""

    future_earnings_text = f"""Future lost earnings represent the present value of the income {data.client_name} is expected to lose from now through the end of their expected career. This takes into account raises, the likelihood of continued employment, taxes, and other factors. Rather than list dozens of years of projections in a complex spreadsheet, we employ an algebraic model to encapsulate the key factors influencing future earnings loss.

According to the methodology described by Tinari (2016), many of the adjustments can be combined into a single formula for clarity. An example of such an algebraic expression is:

AIF = {{[(GE × WLE) × (1 - UF)] × (1 - TL)}} × (1 - PC)

where AIF is the Adjusted Income Factor (a percentage of gross earnings effectively lost), GE is annual Gross Earnings, WLE is the Worklife Expectancy (in years, adjusted for labor force participation), UF is the unemployment factor (probability of unemployment in a given year), TL is the tax liability rate (to get after-tax income), and PC is the personal consumption rate (the portion of income the individual would have spent on themselves).

Application to {data.client_name}: Using the above approach, {data.client_name}'s future lost earning capacity is calculated as follows:

• Base Annual Earnings (GE): We start with {data.client_name}'s expected annual income as of the valuation date. This is ${data.pre_injury_annual_income:,.2f}, based on current pay rate and expected career progression.

• Worklife Expectancy (WLE): Based on {data.client_name}'s age and demographic factors, the statistical worklife remaining is {data.work_life_expectancy:.1f} years. This was determined from standard worklife tables.

• Unemployment Adjustment (UF): To reflect real-world contingencies, an unemployment risk factor of {data.unemployment_rate*100:.1f}% per year is incorporated.

• Fringe Benefits (FB): We adjust the gross earnings upward by {data.fringe_benefits_rate*100:.1f}% to include fringe benefits. Total compensation includes wages plus benefits.

• Taxes (TL): A combined effective tax rate of {data.tax_rate*100:.1f}% is applied to gross earnings to determine after-tax take-home pay.

• Personal Consumption (PC): In this personal injury case where the plaintiff is alive and is the beneficiary of their own earnings, no personal consumption deduction is taken – the full after-tax income is a loss to them.

• Resulting Adjusted Income Factor: Combining the above factors yields an Adjusted Income Factor (AEF) of approximately {aef_result['final_aef']*100:.2f}%.

• Discounting to Present Value: Each future year's lost earnings are present-valued to today using the chosen {data.discount_rate*100:.1f}% discount rate.

The total present value of future lost earnings is calculated to be ${future_total:,.2f}. This represents the lump sum amount that, if invested today at a safe rate, would replace the income {data.client_name} is expected to lose in the future."""

• Prescription medications for pain management
• Periodic diagnostic imaging (MRI, X-rays)
• Potential future surgical interventions
• Medical equipment and assistive devices

The total future medical care cost is estimated at ${data.life_care_plan_cost:,.2f} in present value terms.

All medical cost projections are based on reasonable and necessary care as determined by qualified medical professionals.

These services have measurable economic value and would need to be replaced through hired help or increased effort by family members.

The household services that {data.client_name} can no longer perform include:

• House cleaning and maintenance
• Cooking and meal preparation  
• Yard work and landscaping
• Home repairs and improvements
• Childcare assistance (if applicable)
• Shopping and errands
• Vehicle maintenance

Valuation Methodology: The economic value of these services is calculated using replacement cost methodology, which determines what it would cost to hire qualified personnel to perform these tasks. Hourly rates are based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for domestic service workers in the {data.msa} metropolitan area.

Time Allocation: Based on American Time Use Survey data, the average person in {data.client_name}'s demographic performs approximately 15-20 hours per week of household services. Due to the injury, {data.client_name} can no longer perform approximately 75% of these activities.

Present Value Calculation: The annual value of lost household services is projected over {data.client_name}'s remaining life expectancy and discounted to present value. The total present value of lost household services is estimated at ${data.household_services_cost:,.2f}."""

ECONOMIC LOSS SUMMARY

Past Lost Earnings (to date)                    ${past_total:>15,.2f}
Future Lost Earning Capacity                    ${future_total:>15,.2f}
Future Medical Care Costs                       ${data.life_care_plan_cost:>15,.2f}
Loss of Household Services                      ${data.household_services_cost:>15,.2f}

TOTAL ECONOMIC LOSS                             ${total_economic_loss:>15,.2f}

All amounts are expressed in present value as of {data.date_of_report.strftime('%B %d, %Y')}.

This analysis demonstrates that {data.client_name} has suffered substantial economic losses as a direct result of the injury. The total economic loss of ${total_economic_loss:,.2f} represents the present value of all economic damages that {data.client_name} will experience over their lifetime due to this incident.

The calculations are based on well-established economic principles, reliable data sources, and conservative assumptions. All methodologies employed are consistent with standards in the field of forensic economics and comply with Daubert reliability requirements for expert testimony.

These economic losses represent the financial compensation necessary to restore {data.client_name} to the economic position they would have occupied but for the injury. The analysis provides a comprehensive and reliable foundation for determining appropriate compensation for the economic damages sustained."""
