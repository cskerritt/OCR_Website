## Deployment to AWS Lightsail

### Prerequisites

1. AWS account with Lightsail access
2. Domain name (optional but recommended for production)
3. Basic knowledge of Linux, Docker, and AWS

### Setup AWS Lightsail

1. Create a new Lightsail instance:
   - Go to the AWS Lightsail console: https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com
   - Click "Create instance"
   - Select a Linux/Unix platform (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended)
   - Choose an instance plan (at least 2 GB RAM recommended)
   - Name your instance and click "Create instance"

2. Configure networking:
   - Go to the "Networking" tab of your instance
   - Create a static IP and attach it to your instance
   - Add custom firewall rules to open ports 80 and 443

3. Set up your domain (optional):
   - Configure your domain's DNS to point to the static IP of your Lightsail instance
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)

### Deploy the Application

1. Connect to your Lightsail instance via SSH:
   ```
   ssh ubuntu@your-instance-ip
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cskerritt/OCR_Website.git
   cd OCR_Website
   ```

3. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   ./lightsail-deploy.sh
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to enter your domain name and email for SSL certificates

5. The script will:
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose
   - Configure Caddy with your domain
   - Build and start the Docker containers

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- Check container status:
  ```
  docker-compose ps
  ```

- View logs:
  ```
  docker-compose logs
  ```

- Restart the application:
